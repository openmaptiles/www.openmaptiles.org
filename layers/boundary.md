Contains administrative boundaries as linestrings and aboriginal lands as polygons.
Until z4 [Natural Earth data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) is used after which
OSM boundaries ([`boundary=administrative`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative))
are present from z5 to z14 (also for maritime boundaries with `admin_level <= 2` at z4).
OSM data contains several [`admin_level`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level)
but for most styles it makes sense to just style `admin_level=2` and `admin_level=4`.

## Fields

### class

Use the **class** to differentiate between different kinds of boundaries.  The class for `boundary=aboriginal_lands` is `aboriginal_lands`.

### name

The OSM [`name`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name) value (area features only).

### admin_level

OSM [admin_level](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level)
indicating the level of importance of this boundary.
The `admin_level` corresponds to the lowest `admin_level`
the line participates in.
At low zoom levels the Natural Earth boundaries are mapped to the equivalent admin levels.

### adm0_l

State name on the left of the border. For country boundaries only (`admin_level = 2`).

### adm0_r

State name on the right of the border. For country boundaries only (`admin_level = 2`).

### disputed

Mark with `1` if the border is disputed.

Possible values:

- `0`
- `1`


### disputed_name

Field containing name of the disputed area (extracted from border relation in OSM, without spaces).
For country boundaries only (`admin_level = 2`).
Value examples from Asian OSM pbf extract

Possible values:

- `AbuMusaIsland`
- `BaraHotiiValleys`
- `ChineseClaim`
- `Crimea`
- `Demchok`
- `Dokdo`
- `IndianClaim-North`
- `IndianClaimwesternKashmir`
- `PakistaniClaim`
- `SamduValleys`
- `TirpaniValleys`


### claimed_by

ISO2 code of country, which wants to see the boundary line.
For country boundaries only (`admin_level = 2`).

### maritime

Mark with `1` if it is a maritime border.

Possible values:

- `0`
