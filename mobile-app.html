    <p>Get the source code of mobile app for Android and iOS that is able to
      display OpenStreetMap vector tiles saved in MBTiles format. I works also
      offline and with your GPS location. The <a href="https://maptiler.com/">MapTiler team</a>
      made this app as a starter for your app development!</p>
    <p>Try offline map functionality by downloading a street map for the whole planet,
      country or city of your choice. The map data can also be embedded and
      distributed together with your app!</p>
    <p>This package can significantly speed up a development of your own mobile
      app and save considerable amount of costs for the development.</p>
    <p>The source code, or its parts, can be used in your commercial products or
      any other projects. The code is provided "as is" for the Android and iOS in
      a form of access to a private repository on GitHub (own account needed). It
      is not possible to share the code itself or its parts to third parties.</p>
    <p>The source code of the mapping component is based on
      <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native">MapLibre</a> - the open-source fork of Mapbox SDKs.
      The app itself is written in the native platform programming language (Java on Android, Swift on iOS).</p>
    <p>We have contributed to the MapLibre SDKs (C++) and added code that allows to load the map
      tiles from local MBTiles files that are either bundled with the app or
      downloaded by the user. The map assets (styles, fonts, icons) can be distributed
      together with the app or loaded online.</p>
    <p>The map tiles can come from a server you specify without dependency on
      any single hosting provider. We recommend using the app with
      <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/">MapTiler Cloud</a> or your own
      <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/server/">MapTiler Server</a> installation.
      There is no restriction or monthly payment depending on the number of users of the mobile app.</p>
    <p>Support and customization of this application are not part of this package.</p>
    <p>The source code contains workflows for Github Actions which will save your time
      and increase productivity in your team. Included workflows implement continuous integration
      as wel as automated release management (both App Store and Google Play store).</p>
    <p>The project also comes with the solution for protecting your sensitive files such as certificates or
      provision profiles using git-secret.</p>
    <p>To get clear, actionable insight into app issues the application uses powerful crash reporting
      which you can just reconfigure so that it uses your account.</p>
