      Develop mobile map application with vector tiles generated by the OpenMapTiles project fast for both Android and iOS platforms with Flutter.<br>
      The main advantages are:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Single Codebase for Multiple Platforms</b>: Flutter allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms.</li>
        <li><b>High Performance</b>: Flutter apps are compiled directly to native code, which results in high performance and smooth animations.</li>
        <li><b>Access to Native Features</b>: Flutter grants developers access to native platform features and APIs such as location, sensors, and more.</li>
      </ul>
