## MapTiler Cloud

We are providing a **free reliable maps API** with maps based on **OpenMapTiles schema** with **OpenStreetMap data**. The whole planet is **updated weekly** with **vector** and **raster** tiles available for everyone. 

This is the quickest way how to start and play with maps ([MapTiler Customize tool](https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/customize/)). 

Visit [maptiler.com/cloud](https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/) for more information and start with a free account.
