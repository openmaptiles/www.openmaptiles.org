You can combine OpenMapTiles with any custom raster layer. This includes not only scanned paper map or satellite imagery used as a base layer in your map, but also the semi&#8209;transparent hillshading layer that improves look and feel of standard OpenMapTiles maps.

## Prepare raster tiles

Raster data you want to use for the map should be converted into map tiles first. You can use [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/) for the job. MapTiler is [easy to use](https://www.maptiler.com/how-to/overlay-image-over-map/) and also supports [georeferencing](https://www.maptiler.com/how-to/georeferencing/) in case your raster data do not have geographical position yet. It supports many input formats including PNG, JPEG, GeoTIFF, ECW, or PDF.

We recommend to export map tiles in [MBTiles](https://www.maptiler.com/how-to/folder-mbtiles/) format, but folder as an output is also possible.

## Prepare map style

The next step after creating map tiles is to prepare map style suitable for your data. The easy way is to start with [one of existing GL styles](/styles/) and [edit it locally with Maputnik](/docs/style/maputnik/).

After you clone the style repository and before you start editing in Maputnik, you need to add a source of your raster data. Open `style.json` in a text editor and find `sources` section. It should look like this:

```json
  "sources": {
    "openmaptiles": {
      "type": "vector",
      "url": "https://api.maptiler.com/tiles/v3-openmaptiles/tiles.json?key={key}"
    }
  },
```

Add new source with reference to your map tiles:

```json
  "sources": {
    "openmaptiles": {
      "type": "vector",
      "url": "https://api.maptiler.com/tiles/v3-openmaptiles/tiles.json?key={key}"
    },
    "mymaptiles": {
      "type": "raster",
      "url": "path/to/your/file.mbtiles"
    }
  },
```

Then you can start editing your style in Maputnik and adjust it as you want. Editing raster layer style may be very easy:

```json
{
  "id": "mylayer",
  "type": "raster",
  "source": "mymaptiles",
  "layout": {
    "visibility": "visible"
  }
}
```

After you adjust the style, your map is ready.

## Viewing the map

The final map can be served as a combination of OpenMapTiles and raster MBTiles, as well as a single raster tileset using [TileServer GL](/docs/host/tileserver-gl/).
