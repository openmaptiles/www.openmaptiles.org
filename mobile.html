    <p>Presented are online & offline OpenStreetMap vector tiles created by OpenMapTiles team, designed in MapTiler Customize, and stored in MBTiles.</p>
    <p>The raster tiles are generated from open data (GeoTIFF geodata) by <a href="http://www.maptiler.com/">MapTiler</a>.</p>

    <p>The maps are powered by the MapLibre library, which loads maps from MapTiler Cloud. Look&feel of the map is derived from the <a href="/styles/#osm-bright">OSM Bright style</a>. It can be adjusted to display features, information, and colors according to the intended use case.</p>
